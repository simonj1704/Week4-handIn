    <p>Async await is a way to handle promises.</p>
    <p>It is a prefered way to handle promises because it makes asyncrounus code look like syncrounus code.</p>
    <p>I have used it every time i am using fetch. To use it you have to a function with the keyword asynd and then use await in front of the fetch.</p>
    <p>To use errorhandling you have to use Try catch blocks.</p>
